# Fantasy Baseball Auction Value Calculator — Build Prompt

## Overview

Build a polished, production-grade React application that helps fantasy baseball managers generate custom auction draft values based on their specific league settings, then manage live draft inflation tracking.

---

## Design Direction

**Tone**: Baseball card meets modern fintech — nostalgic warmth with sharp, precise data visualization. Think vintage baseball card typography paired with clean, modern data tables.

**Color Palette**: 
- Rich baseball leather browns and warm creams for nostalgia
- Crisp navy and forest green accents for data emphasis
- Warm paper/parchment backgrounds that feel like a well-worn scouting report

**Typography**: 
- A characterful display font for headers (think classic sports typography — condensed, bold, with personality)
- A highly readable monospace or tabular font for numbers and data tables
- Clean sans-serif for body text

**Vibe**: This should feel like a tool a serious fantasy baseball analyst would *love* to use — professional enough for hardcore number-crunchers, but warm and inviting enough that it doesn't feel like a spreadsheet.

## Application Structure

### Page 1: League Settings & Value Generator

This is the setup page where users configure their league and generate auction values.

#### Section A: League Configuration

**League Basics**
- League name (optional, for saving/reference)
- Number of teams (dropdown: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or custom input)
- Auction budget per team (default $260, allow custom)
- Total roster spots per team

**Position Requirements**
Allow users to specify how many of each position they need to draft:
- C (Catcher)
- 1B (First Base)
- 2B (Second Base)
- 3B (Third Base)
- SS (Shortstop)
- OF (Outfield) — typically 3-5 slots

Display a running count: "Total roster spots configured: X" with validation against the total roster spots setting.

#### Section B: Scoring Format Selection

Provide three mutually exclusive scoring format options with a clean tab or card-based selector:

**Option 1: Rotisserie (Categories)**

When selected, show a category picker with common roto categories:

*Hitting Categories* (checkboxes):
- R (Runs)
- HR (Home Runs)

- OBP (On-Base Percentage)
- SLG (Slugging Percentage)
- OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging)
- TB (Total Bases)
- H (Hits)
- BB (Walks)
- K (Strikeouts — negative for hitters)
- Custom category input

*Pitching Categories* (checkboxes):
- W (Wins)
- SV (Saves)
- K (Strikeouts)

**Option 2: Head-to-Head Categories**

Same category selection interface as Roto, but with an explanatory note: "Each week you'll face an opponent. Win each category to earn points toward playoff seeding."

**Option 3: Head-to-Head Points**

When selected, show a points configuration panel:

*Hitting Point Values* (number inputs with +/- steppers):

---

### Page 2: Live Draft Room with Inflation Calculator

This is the real-time draft management tool.

#### Section A: Draft Setup (if not coming from Page 1)

- Quick league settings summary
- Import values from Page 1 or upload pre-generated values CSV

#### Section B: Draft Board Header

**Key Metrics Dashboard** (always visible, updates in real-time):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BUDGET REMAINING     PLAYERS LEFT      INFLATION RATE    AVG $/PLAYER│
│      $187              234               +12.4%             $4.23     │
│   (of $260)         (of 312)           ↑ from 0%         (adj: $4.75)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Section C: Player Draft Entry

**Quick Draft Interface**
Two ways to record a drafted player:

1. **Search & Select**
   - Type-ahead search box
   - Shows player name, position, your projected value
   - Click to select

2. **Click from Table**
   - Click any undrafted player row to select them

**After Selection, Prompt**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mike Trout (OF) — Your Value: $42          │
│                                              │
│  Actual Draft Price: $[_______]             │
│                                              │
│  Drafted by: [Your Team ▼]  (optional)       │
│                                              │
│  [ Cancel ]              [ Confirm Draft ]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Section D: Inflation-Adjusted Player Values Table

**The Core Table** — this is where the magic happens:

| Player | Pos | Orig $ | Adj $ | Δ | Status |
|--------|-----|--------|-------|---|--------|
| Aaron Judge | OF | $38 | $42.71 | +$4.71 | Available |
| Shohei Ohtani | DH/SP | $52 | $58.42 | +$6.42 | Available |
| Ronald Acuña | OF | — | — | — | DRAFTED ($54) |

**Inflation Calculation Logic**:
```
Remaining Budget Pool = (Total League Budget) - (Total $ Spent So Far)
Remaining Value Pool = Sum of (Original Values) for undrafted players
Inflation Rate = (Remaining Budget Pool / Remaining Value Pool) - 1
Adjusted Value = Original Value × (1 + Inflation Rate)
```

**Table Features**:
- Drafted players grayed out but visible (toggle to hide)
- Sort by Adjusted Value (default), Original Value, Position
- Filter by position
- Search undrafted players
- "My Targets" flag — star players to highlight them
- Color-code value changes: green for inflation (costs more), red for deflation (bargains)

#### Section E: Draft Log

**Collapsible Panel** showing draft history:

```
#47  Mike Trout (OF)      You: $42    Actual: $48    +$6 overpay
#46  Gerrit Cole (SP)     You: $28    Actual: $31    +$3 overpay  
#45  Julio Rodriguez (OF) You: $35    Actual: $29    -$6 VALUE!
...
```

- Undo last pick button
- Clear all button (with confirmation)
- Export draft log

#### Section F: Positional Needs Tracker (Optional Enhancement)

If user configured roster requirements:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR ROSTER NEEDS                       │
│  C: 0/1  │  1B: 0/1  │  OF: 1/3         │
│  2B: 0/1 │  SS: 1/1 ✓│  SP: 2/5         │
│  3B: 0/1 │  MI: 0/1  │  RP: 0/2         │
│                                          │
│  Budget Remaining: $187                  │
│  Roster Spots Left: 19                   │
│  Min $ per remaining spot: $9.84         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management
- Use React Context or Zustand for global state (league settings, player values, draft state)
- Persist to localStorage so users don't lose their draft progress on refresh
- Consider IndexedDB for larger projection datasets

### CSV Parsing
- Use PapaParse for robust CSV handling
- Handle edge cases: quoted commas, special characters in names, various encodings

### Calculations
- Memoize expensive calculations (inflation adjustments affect all players)
- Use Web Workers for initial value generation if dataset is large
- Debounce inflation recalculations during rapid draft entry

### Data Validation
- Validate CSV structure before accepting
- Warn on missing required columns
- Handle duplicate player names gracefully

### Responsive Design
- Desktop-first (this is a draft day tool, likely on a laptop)
- But ensure tablet usability for those following along on iPad
- Mobile: at minimum, show inflation-adjusted values table

---

## Polish & Delight Details

### Micro-interactions
- Satisfying button press animations
- Smooth table row transitions when players are drafted
- Subtle confetti or highlight when you land a "value pick" (actual < projected)
- Number counters that animate when values update

### Empty States
- Friendly illustrations for "No projections uploaded yet"
- Helpful prompts: "Start by configuring your league settings above"

### Error Handling
- Friendly error messages with suggested fixes
- "This doesn't look like a projections file. Expected columns like R, HR, RBI..."
- Auto-recovery from localStorage if possible

### Onboarding
- Optional first-time walkthrough tooltip tour
- "Sample League" button to load demo data and explore

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation through tables and forms
- High contrast mode toggle
- Screen reader friendly value announcements

## Summary

This app should feel like your secret weapon on draft day — the tool that makes you feel prepared, informed, and confident. Every interaction should feel snappy, every number should be trustworthy, and the inflation calculator should update in real-time so you always know exactly what each player is worth as the draft unfolds.

Build something you'd be proud to use in your own league. ⚾💰
